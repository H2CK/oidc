- Supported signing algorithms RS256 (default) and HS256
- Group memberships are passed as roles in JWT token.
- Discovery endpoint provided

Full documentation can be found at:

- [User Documentation](https://github.com/H2CK/oidc/wiki#user-documentation)
- [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/H2CK/oidc/wiki#developer-documentation)

## Endpoints

The following endpoint are available below `index.php/apps/oidc/`:

- Discovery: `openid-configuration` (GET)
- Authorization: `authorize`(GET)
- Token: `token`(POST)
- UserInfo: `userinfo`(GET - Authentication with previously retrieved access token)
- JWKS: `jwks`(GET)
- Logout: `logout` (GET - ?refresh_token=xxx)

CORS is enable for all domains on all the above endpoints.

The discovery endpoint should be made available at the URL: `<Issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration`. You may have to configure your web server to redirect this url to the discovery endpoint at `<Issuer>/index.php/apps/oidc/openid-configuration`.

## Limitations

Currently it is not yet possible to use an issued JWT Token to access resource at the Nextcloud instance it self. (Future implementation planned)

Client authentication to fetch token currently only supports the sending of the client credentials in the body. Basic Auth is currently not supported.

## Development

To install it change into your Nextcloud's apps directory:

    cd nextcloud/apps

Then clone this repository.

Following install the dependencies using:

    make composer

## Frontend development

The app requires to have Node and npm installed.

- üë©‚Äçüíª Run `make dev-setup` to install the frontend dependencies
- üèó To build the Javascript whenever you make changes, run `make build-js`

To continuously run the build when editing source files you can make use of the `make watch-js` command.

## Translations

Translations are done using Transifex. If you like to contribute and do some translations please visit [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/nextcloud/nextcloud/oidc/).

Before using Transifex, translations were made with a local translation tool. For installation of the necessary tools execute `make translationtool`. To create the pot file from the source code execute `make generate-po-translation`. After creating the po translation files under translationfiles/...LANGUAGE-CODE.../oidc.po you must execute `make generate-nc-translation` to generate the necessary nextcloud translation files.

## Build app bundle

Execute `make build` to build for production bundle at build/artifacts. Perform `make appstore` to create tar.gz in build/artifacts.

### Releasing

To create a new release the following files must be modified and contain the new version.

- appinfo/info.xml
- package.json
- CHANGELOG.md

## Execute test

Execute `make test` to run phpunit tests.

### Manual testing of BackgroundJobs

Execute  `php -dxdebug.remote_host=localhost -f cron.php`

To run the job again if you have errors, however, you may have to remove it from the oc_jobs table and disable/reenable the app.

## TODOs / Ideas for extensions

- Support other methods to transport client_credentials (in query / body)
- Basic Auth support for token endpoint (Basic Auth is currently catched by Nextcloud)
- GET support for token endpoint
- Add authentication backend to allow usage of JWT to access resources at Nextcloud server
- Create unit and integration tests
