This is the an OIDC App for Nextcloud. This application allows to use your Nextcloud Login at other services supporting OpenID Connect.
Hint: Up to now it is not possible to use the provided Access Tokens or ID Tokens to access resources (e.g. files, calendars, ...) from your Nextcloud instance. Only the Authorization Codes can be used to fetch the Access Tokens / ID Tokens at the `/token` endpoint.

Provided features:

- Support for OpenID Connect Code (response_type = code) and Implicit (response_type = id_token) Flow (since version 0.4.0) - Implicite Flow must be activated per client.
- Configuration of accepted client for whom JWT Tokens are provided. Public and confidential types are supported.
- Creation of JWT Token with claims based on requested scope. (Currently supported scopes openid, profile, email, roles and groups)
- Supported signing algorithms RS256 (default) and HS256
- Group memberships are passed as roles in JWT token.
- Clients can be assigned to dedicated user groups. Only users in the configured group are allowed to retrieve an access token to fetch the JWT.
- Discovery endpoint provided
- Logout endpoint

Full documentation can be found at:

- [User Documentation](https://github.com/H2CK/oidc/wiki#user-documentation)
- [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/H2CK/oidc/wiki#developer-documentation)

## Endpoints

The following endpoint are available below `index.php/apps/oidc/`:

- Discovery: `openid-configuration` (GET)
- Authorization: `authorize`(GET)
- Token: `token`(POST)
- UserInfo: `userinfo`(GET / POST - Authentication with previously retrieved access token)
- JWKS: `jwks`(GET)
- Logout: `logout` (GET)

CORS is enable for all domains on all the above endpoints.

The discovery endpoint should be made available at the URL: `<Issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration`. You may have to configure your web server to redirect this url to the discovery endpoint at `<Issuer>/index.php/apps/oidc/openid-configuration`.

### Logout Details

To support logout functionality the discovery enpoint contains the attribute `end_session_endpoint`to announce the support for [RP-Initiated logout](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0.html). The current implementation only partially supports this specification.

Current limitations:

- Only GET requests to logout endpoint are supported (POST might be added in future)
- Only the optional attributes `id_token_hint`, `client_id` and `post_logout_redirect_uri` are supported

Remark on `post_logout_redirect_uri`: The passed URIs are checked against the list of allowed logout redirect URIs from the app configuration. The provided `post_logout_redirect_uri` must start with one of the configured URIs.
If no `post_logout_redirect_uri` is passed or the `post_logout_redirect_uri` does not match any allowed redirect URI, there will be a redirect to the login page of the Nextcloud instance.

Up to now there is NO support for:

- [OpenID Connect Session Management](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html)
- [OpenID Connect Front-Channel Logout](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-frontchannel-1_0.html)
- [OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html)

## Scopes

| Scope | Description |
|---|---|
| openid | Default scope. Will be added if missing. |
| profile | Adds the claims `name`and `updated_at`to the ID Token. |
| email | Adds the email address of the user to the claim `email`. Furthermore the claim `email_verified` is added. |
| roles | Adds the groups of the user in the claim `roles`. |
| groups | Adds the groups of the user in the claim `groups`. |

## Limitations

Currently it is not yet possible to use an issued Access Token or ID Token to access resources at the Nextcloud instance it self.

Client authentication to fetch token currently only supports the sending of the client credentials in the body. Basic Auth is currently not supported.

## Development

To install it change into your Nextcloud's apps directory:

    cd nextcloud/apps

Then clone this repository.

Following install the dependencies using:

    make composer

## Frontend development

The app requires to have Node and npm installed.

- üë©‚Äçüíª Run `make dev-setup` to install the frontend dependencies
- üèó To build the Javascript whenever you make changes, run `make build-js`

To continuously run the build when editing source files you can make use of the `make watch-js` command.

## Translations

Translations are done using Transifex. If you like to contribute and do some translations please visit [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/nextcloud/nextcloud/oidc/).

Before using Transifex, translations were made with a local translation tool. For installation of the necessary tools execute `make translationtool`. To create the pot file from the source code execute `make generate-po-translation`. After creating the po translation files under translationfiles/...LANGUAGE-CODE.../oidc.po you must execute `make generate-nc-translation` to generate the necessary nextcloud translation files.

## Build app bundle

Execute `make build` to build for production bundle at build/artifacts. Perform `make appstore` to create tar.gz in build/artifacts.

### Releasing

To create a new release the following files must be modified and contain the new version.

- appinfo/info.xml
- package.json
- CHANGELOG.md

## Execute test

Execute `make test` to run phpunit tests.

### Manual testing of BackgroundJobs

Execute  `php -dxdebug.remote_host=localhost -f cron.php`

To run the job again if you have errors, however, you may have to remove it from the oc_jobs table and disable/reenable the app.

## TODOs / Ideas for extensions

- Support other methods to transport client_credentials (in query / body)
- Basic Auth support for token endpoint (Basic Auth is currently catched by Nextcloud)
- GET support for token endpoint
- Add authentication backend to allow usage of JWT to access resources at Nextcloud server
- Create unit and integration tests
